The getLearnerData function is designed to process learner submissions for a specific course and assignment group, calculating scores, averages, and handling late submissions. It takes in a course object, an assignment group with its associated assignments, and an array of submissions. The function validates that the assignment group belongs to the course, iterates through the submissions, applies late penalties, and computes each learner's overall performance. The final output is an array of learner records, each containing their average score and assignment details. This utility is ideal for educators or administrators who need to quickly analyze and summarize student performance based on submission data.
